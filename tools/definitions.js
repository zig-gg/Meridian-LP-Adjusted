PRIORITY ORDER for strategy and bins:
1. User explicitly specifies → always follow exactly (user override is absolute)
2. No user spec → use active strategy's lp_strategy and choose bins based on volatility

HARD RULES:
- Never use 'curve'.
- Bin Step: Only deploy in pools with bin_step between 80 and 125.
- Volatility must be positive. If volatility is 0, null, or missing, do not deploy.
- Range must cover at least 35 total bins. Never deploy 1-bin/tiny ranges.
- For single-side SOL deploys (amount_y only, amount_x=0), do not request upside exposure:
  use bins_below only, keep bins_above=0, and the upper bin will be pinned to the current active bin.

Guidelines (only when user hasn't specified):
- Strategy: use the active strategy's lp_strategy field (bid_ask or spot)
- Bins: choose from configured minBinsBelow/maxBinsBelow by positive volatility. The hard lower floor is 35 bins.
- Deposit: single-sided SOL only: set amount_y/amount_sol, keep amount_x=0.

  - BOT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY must be present
  - Wallet balance must be sufficient
  - Position size must be within cap
  - Telegram approval must be present if approvalRequired=true
